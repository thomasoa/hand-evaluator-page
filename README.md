# hand-evaluator-page
A pure JavaScript version of my old interactive hand evaluator that was made inoperable by a migration of my website to a new platform.

Goals of this implementation:
* Make it stand-alone, so a person can save the page and run it offline
* Support CCCC first, along with the simpler evaluator (HCP, for example)
* Implement other evaluators later.
